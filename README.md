# Custom Rubik's Cube Timer

This project was heavily inspired by [csTimer](https://cstimer.net/) and motivated by my love for solving the Rubik's cube.

## Runing the project 

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
